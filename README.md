## Abstract

This document presents a comprehensive technical analysis of an IoT-based people counting and automatic lighting control system designed for intelligent space management. The system utilizes ultrasonic distance sensors coupled with a directional detection algorithm to accurately count individuals entering and exiting a monitored space. The primary function is automated lighting control: lights turn on when people are present and automatically turn off when the room becomes empty, providing significant energy savings and convenience.

## 1. Introduction

Energy efficiency in buildings is a critical concern for both environmental and economic reasons. Traditional lighting systems rely on manual switches or simple motion detectors that often leave lights on in empty rooms. This project implements an intelligent people counting system using ultrasonic sensors that provides precise occupancy tracking for automated lighting control.

The system's core functionality includes:

1. **Accurate bidirectional people counting** using strategically positioned ultrasonic distance sensors
2. **Automatic lighting control** - lights turn ON when people enter, stay ON while occupied, turn OFF when empty
3. **Real-time occupancy monitoring** with web-based dashboard for facility management
4. **Energy savings through precise vacancy detection** - eliminates lights left on in empty rooms
5. **Data logging for usage analysis** - track room utilization patterns and energy savings

The ultrasonic sensor approach provides several advantages over traditional PIR sensors:
- More precise distance measurements for better directional detection
- Less susceptible to temperature variations and air currents
- Better performance in various lighting conditions
- Ability to detect stationary objects and slow-moving individuals

## 2. System Architecture

The system follows a three-tier architecture comprising ultrasonic sensor hardware, a middleware processing layer, and a presentation interface with data persistence.

    IDLE --> PERSON_AT_ENTRY: Entry sensor detects object
    IDLE --> PERSON_AT_EXIT: Exit sensor detects object

    distance_exit = measureDistance(EXIT_SENSOR)
    
    if (time_since_last_event < quiet_window):
        return  // Prevent rapid retriggering

                    turn_lights_OFF()

    B --> C[Turn Lights ON]
    B --> D[Log Entry Event]

```

### 5.1 LED Control Logic

```cpp
// Called when entry is detected
void handlePersonEntry() {
    occupancyCount++;
    
    // Turn on lights when first person enters
    if (occupancyCount == 1) {
        digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);  // Turn on room lights
        lightsStatus = "on";
        logEvent("lights_on");
    }
    
    sendEvent("entry");
}

// Called when exit is detected
void handlePersonExit() {
    if (occupancyCount > 0) {
        occupancyCount--;
    }
    
    // Turn off lights when last person exits
    if (occupancyCount == 0) {
        digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);   // Turn off room lights
        lightsStatus = "off";
        triggerVacancyAlert();        // 3-second alert beep
        logEvent("lights_off");
        logEvent("energy_saved");
    }
    
    sendEvent("exit");
}
```

|------------|-------------------|----------|---------|
| Vacancy Beep | Occupancy drops to 0 | 3 seconds | Confirms room is empty and lights are off |
| System Ready | Device startup | 1 second | Indicates system is operational |
| Error Alert | Sensor malfunction | 5 beeps | Alerts to system issues |

## 7. Power Consumption Analysis

Energy efficiency analysis for the people counting system versus traditional lighting controls.

| Component | Active Mode (mA) | Sleep Mode (mA) | Duty Cycle (%) | Avg. Current (mA) |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| ESP8266 | 80 | 20 | 40 | 44 |
| Ultrasonic Sensors (×2) | 30 | 5 | 20 | 11 |

*Based on typical room usage patterns

**Energy Savings Analysis:**
- Traditional always-on lighting: 60W × 24h = 1.44 kWh/day
- Smart system lighting: 60W × 8h (occupied) = 0.48 kWh/day
- **Daily savings: 0.96 kWh (67% reduction)**
